# The-Art-of-doing


 The art of doing is the art form of transforming oneself from a passive learner who watches, to one who sees the process of learning for what it truly is; a mechanism to better oneself.  ​In "The Art of Doing", I have worked very hard to put together 40 meaningful, engaging, and purposeful "Challenge Problems" for you to solve. ​ Each challenge problem is differentiated for 3 levels of learning.
